    <h1>claim</h1>
    <p>I think that there has to be three tubes, one for normal water and the other 2  are  the one that's colored water and the other one is that doesn’t  make the water come out of the mystery box.</p>
    <h1>Evidence</h1>
    <p>The mystery black box is a box that has a mystery to it of how it functions and how it works . We were observing the account of  how much water we put in and the amount of water that  came out . For our first trial we dropped 1k of water into our  mystery box and  zero  water came out and for our second trial we put the same amount of water and 550 water came out  . For our class trials we put in 500(mL) and 1915 came out of the box; it's pretty much random. It has some patterns. Our approach for figuring out  how it works was taking data from the mystery box.</p>
    <h1>Reasoning Part 1</h1>
    <p>Our model had some similar to the real mystery box cause sometimes the water didn’t come out and some did so there had to be 3 buckets in the box.</p>
